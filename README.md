# Feature-encoding-Visual-Short-term-Memory

Research Question: Does fragile visual short-term memory preserve the detail of higher-order features (e.g., shapes, colors) more accurately than working memory?

Every time we look at a completely new scene, we feel as if we can sense every detail at once; however, our feeling of "seeing everything" is considered an illusion since we have limited capacity to report it when closing our eyes (Naccache, 2018), suggesting that our Working memory (WM), the amount of information we can retain at a moment, is extremely limited and non-detailed. Recent work has identified fragile visual short-term memory (fVSTM), which has near-perfect capacity and contains more detailed images (Sligte et al., 2010) but is very fragile and short-lived (Sligte et al., 2008) compared to standard working memory, as indicated by fVSTM outperforming WM in change-detection tasks. Research shows this memory is object-based, as it will be harder to be recalled if the encoding process of an object is interfered with by a similar object than by a different object (Pinto et al., 2013). However, little is known about how detailed the features of those objects are encoded since most of the existing work compares objects that differ drastically in their features (e.g., a pink pig vs a red motorbike), potentially making the detection easier, and there are also challenging ideas that fVSTM mostly contains gist-like information, like an instant flash and blurry images (Block, 2011) instead of a clear picture.
